This repository contains visualizations prototypes created by the DHARPA team with [Observable](http://observablehq.com/).</br>
Each sub-folder is specific to a single visualization and it contains a readme file with the description about the viz inputs and outputs, a folder with the observable back-up code, and an example jupyter notebook to create sample data for the viz.
